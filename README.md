# RAG-Chatbot
A chatbot using RAG with AI21's Jamba model that reads a legislative document and answers questions from the user about it


This is some code I wanted to save for further use that utilizes Jamba in LangChain for a RAG chatbot

This code was originally from DeepLearning.AI's course on building AI apps with Jamba, but I have modified it to have it read legislative documents and explain them to the user via questions


In this notebook, I try out using AI21's tools to create a simple chatbot that can read a U.S. legislative document and understand it

Overall, the model does pretty well, although I question if it can understand the nuances of politics and the making of bills in the legislative branch

If perfect, it can save a lot of time reading the document, which is over 117,000 words in length

I may improve this model in the future by providing additional documents which are relevant to understanding bills
