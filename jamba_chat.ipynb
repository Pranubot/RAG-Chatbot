The total appropriations amount to $45,637,400,000, which will remain available until September 30, 2031.\n================================================================================\nQuestion: Is this bill proposing any changes to the federal budget?\nAnswer: Yes, the bill proposes several changes to the federal budget, including appropriations for various government agencies and programs, such as the Internal Revenue Service, \n        the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the National Park Service. It also includes provisions for the appropriation of funds for specific purposes, such as conservation \n        technical assistance and the improvement of energy or water efficiency in affordable housing.\n================================================================================\nQuestion: Will this affect taxes on the rich, and if so, by how much?\nAnswer: Yes, the amendments will affect taxes on the rich. The increase in research credit against payroll tax for small businesses will not affect the rich. However, \n        the gross-up of direct spending will increase the portion of any payment made to a taxpayer pursuant to an election under section 6417 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, \n        or any amount treated as a payment which is made by the taxpayer under subsection (a) of such section, that is direct spending shall be increased by 6.0445 percent. This could affect the rich, \n        as they are more likely to have higher direct spending.\n\"\"\"",
